# ttwatcher

Application to process .ttbin files and download files from TT Sport Watch. 

I was having issues with my TT Sport watch and needed a way to process the .ttbin 
files that the watch was giving us but were corrupted. A quick search showed the 
two projects below had done a lot of the ground work but were written 
for Linux. So I set out to make a quick and dirty Windows version so I could 
experiment with improving the ttbin parsing / communications.

**DISCLAIMER: I STRONGLY SUGGEST USING THE OFFICIAL APP TO DOWNLOAD YOUR ttbin 
files.**
